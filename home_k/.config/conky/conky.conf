## How strict should if_up be when testing an interface for being up?
## The value is one of up, link or address, to check for the interface
## being solely up, being up and having link or being up, having link

if_up_strictness address

## Add spaces to keep things from moving about?  This only affects certain objects.
## use_spacer should have an argument of left, right, or none
use_spacer left

## number of cpu samples to average
## set to 1 to disable averaging
